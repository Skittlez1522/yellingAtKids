        <h2>What does this law state?</h2>
        <p>The law of universal gravitation states that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between centers</p>
        <p>This means that everything in the universe exerts a gravitational pull on all objects within the range of its gravity. The range of gravity is determined by the size of the object. The larger the mass of the object giving on a gravitational pull, the larger area the gravity covers. Yet, the gravity doesn't reach infinite distances because as the force of gravity travels, it grows smaller.</p>
        <h2>Facts about the law of universal graviation.</h2>
        <p>It was developed by Isaac Newton</p>
        <p>It was developed in the late 1600s</p>
        <p>The story that Isaac Newton developed this law after an apple fell on his head is false.</p>
